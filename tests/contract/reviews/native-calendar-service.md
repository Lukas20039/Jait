# Native calendar account service

Reference: `packages/gateway/src/services/calendar/service.ts`.
Native: `packages/gateway-rust/src/services/calendar/service.rs`.
Contracts: `gateway_rust_calendar_service`; test-only adapter `drivers/nativecalendarservice.ts`.

The opt-in library service uses the bounded SQLite worker, native encrypted user secrets, native OAuth and Google Calendar clients. It does not discover or open the production database. A caller must supply the database, secrets, transport and credentials. No production startup or outbound provider operation is activated by this change.

Six differential scenarios execute the real TypeScript CalendarService and native service against disposable migrated SQLite databases. They compare returned values, actual HTTP request parameters, account and snapshot rows, decrypted secret values and last-used timestamps. Native restart closes and reopens the physical fixture database; reference restart reconstructs its service over the same fixture connection. Only random IDs and OAuth entropy are normalized; PKCE challenge/verifier correspondence and entropy shape are checked. SQL failure messages are normalized only for explicitly injected failures, while returned and durable partial effects remain exact. Snapshot JSON and token JSON are compared as values; object serialization order is not an interface assertion here.

Coverage includes per-user/environment/Gmail credential precedence and side effects; partial credential saves; account ownership, anonymous accounts, upserts and disconnect; device snapshot defaults, filtering, sorting, fractional/clamped limits, corrupt JSON fallback and persistence; single-use OAuth callbacks, ten-minute collection boundary and state consumption on failure; missing email, missing credentials, denied OAuth and failed token persistence; valid, missing, malformed, expired and refreshed stored tokens; provider calendar selection, parallel event batches, cancelled events, sort/limit, unknown calendar and network errors. All six scenarios plus four shared driver tests pass.

Three surgical mutations remove account ownership, change the 60-second refresh boundary, and retain callback state after completion. Each fails a real differential assertion. Original sources are restored and the same ten tests pass. Logs: `.jait/artifacts/gateway-rust/calendar-service/`.

Limits: typed calendar/device records and finite well-formed JSON are the native adapter boundary. Date inputs cover ISO/RFC3339 timestamps and date-only values; implementation-dependent JavaScript Date.parse formats are not established. Supported-platform tests, authenticated calendar HTTP/tools integration, native startup activation and real Google accounts remain separate gates. Provider I/O is injected at the HTTP boundary; OAuth and Calendar request/response behavior is independently covered by `gateway_rust_calendar`, including real loopback HTTP transport.
